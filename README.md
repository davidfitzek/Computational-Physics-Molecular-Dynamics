# Molecular-dynamics-simulation-static-properties

we are going to investigate static properties of aluminum-particles in a molecular dynamics simulation. 

256 particles are placed on a 3d grid with spacing $a_0$ in a box with periodic boundary conditions. 

For more detailes see the document MD simulation - static properties.pdf.
